This is a folder where I test the result of compression or cropping
The compressuion notebook should be changed for each compression type manually and I have to make it more general and comprehensive that is why it is named compression draft

the cropping done by Tasneem is great so no extra insight is drawn from that investigation rather than seeing how the cropped images have widely different file sizes (Kb). see histogram.
