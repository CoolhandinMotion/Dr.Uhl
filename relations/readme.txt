This is a folder where I investigated the effect of tweeking parameters on how the compressed image size on disk changes (in Kb) for example I figured out that with JPEG2000 there almost exist a linear relationship that predicts if you wanna reduce file size by x% on disk via compression, you need to set the parameters to y.

JPEG is pretty straight forward because its quality parameter is bounded between [0,95]

Webp also was also investigated to see how the file size changes with regards to parameter change.
